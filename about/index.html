    <p><strong>How is Daniel?</strong> is a project made by me, Daniel. The source code is <a href="https://github.com/dbartel/daniel-status">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>I spend probably too much time online, and use too many social networks.
        I thought it would be interesting if I could analyze what I'm doing online and relate it to how I feel in the real world.

    <p>
        I built a bot which grabs all posts from the last 24 hours, performs sentiment analysis on each post, and generates a web page about it.
        Also, randomly during the day, I receive a notification on my phone to post a picture to Instagram - which the bot puts on the page.
